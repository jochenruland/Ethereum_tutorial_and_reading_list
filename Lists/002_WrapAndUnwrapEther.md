## Wrapping and unwrapping ether
Ether is not an ERC20 token. In order to trade ether on most digital exchanges
you have to convert ether to an ERC20 version of ether which is called wrapped ether (wEth).
Most digital exchanges do this implicitly when sending eth to their functions but
sometimes you have to do it in advance or at least unwrap the wEth in oder to
receive eth after a trade.
